## Hello :earth_americas:!

I have created this website to move away from my original blog on [WordPress](https://chefsitcompendium.wixsite.com/chefs). I have it hosted on [Github](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub#:~:text=GitHub%2C%20Inc.,and%20wikis%20for%20every%20project.) as a [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site) website for free. I have written it in HTML and CSS to create what you see [here](https://xxlmandalorian013.github.io/Chef-s-IT-Compendium.github.io/.). A few of the reasons I wanted to switch to GitHub Pages and use [Markdown](https://xxlmandalorian013.github.io/Chef-s-IT-Compendium.github.io/.) is Markdown is plain text. So no matter where I keep my posts, all work thus far will be easy to move into another platform should I choose. I also plan to re-create my OneNote knowledge base into Markdown docs.

To get my website to what it is now, I heavily referenced [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) to write the HTML and CSS. Once I did some code writing, I wanted a way to view my work and how it would render once pushed to my [repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories), so I started using [VSCode Edge Dev Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-edgedevtools.vscode-edge-devtools) to preview it. To generate large amounts of text to see how my website would react to how I wrote some of the CSS, I used this [loremipsum](https://loremipsum.io/) generator. I used a [favicon generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) to create the fun little picture at the top of each site page. To generate my siteâ€™s social media icons, I use [icon-icons](https://icon-icons.com/). I also reference [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/quickstart-for-writing-on-github) for writing markdown on their site, more on this in a future post. To create AI generate images, I have been really into [Microsoft Designer](https://designer.microsoft.com/).

I am super excited to be able to roll this out finally, and I already have several future posts up my sleeve!
