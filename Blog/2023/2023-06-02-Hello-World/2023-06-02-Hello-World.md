In an attempt to get away from my original blog on [WordPress](https://chefsitcompendium.wixsite.com/chefs), I have created this website. I have it hosted on [Github](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub#:~:text=GitHub%2C%20Inc.,and%20wikis%20for%20every%20project.) as a [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site) website for free. I have written HTML and CSS to create what you are seeing here.
