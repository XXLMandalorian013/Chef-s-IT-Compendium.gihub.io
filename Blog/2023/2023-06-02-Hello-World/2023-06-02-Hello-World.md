In an attempt to get away from my original blog on [WordPress](https://chefsitcompendium.wixsite.com/chefs), I have created this website. I have it hosted on [Github](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub#:~:text=GitHub%2C%20Inc.,and%20wikis%20for%20every%20project.) as a [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site) website for free. I have written it in HTML and CSS to create what you are seeing [here](https://xxlmandalorian013.github.io/Chef-s-IT-Compendium.github.io/.). A few of the reason I wanted to switch to GitHub Pages and use [Markdown](https://xxlmandalorian013.github.io/Chef-s-IT-Compendium.github.io/.) is Markdown is plain text. So no matter where I keep my posts all work thus far will be easy to move into another platform should I so choose. I also have been planning on re-create my OneNote knowledge base into Markdown docs.

To get my website to what it is now, I heavily referenced [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) to write the HTML and CSS. Once I did some code writing I wanted a way to view my work and how it would render once pushed to my [repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories), so I started using [VSCode Edge Dev Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-edgedevtools.vscode-edge-devtools) to preview it. To generate large amounts of text to see how my website would react with how I wrote some of the CSS I used this [loremipsum](https://loremipsum.io/) generator. To create the fun little picture in the top of each sites pages, I used a [favicon generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/). To generate my sites social media icons, I use [icon-icons](https://icon-icons.com/).
