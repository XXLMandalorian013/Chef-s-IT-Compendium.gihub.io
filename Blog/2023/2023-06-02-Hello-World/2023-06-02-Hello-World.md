In an attempt to get away from my original blog on [WordPress](https://chefsitcompendium.wixsite.com/chefs), I have created this website. I have it hosted on [Github](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub#:~:text=GitHub%2C%20Inc.,and%20wikis%20for%20every%20project.) as a [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site) website for free. I have written it in HTML and CSS to create what you are seeing [here](https://xxlmandalorian013.github.io/Chef-s-IT-Compendium.github.io/.). A few of the reason I wanted to switch to GitHub Pages and use [Markdown](https://xxlmandalorian013.github.io/Chef-s-IT-Compendium.github.io/.) is Markdown is plain text. So no matter where I keep my posts all work thus far will be easy to move into another platform should I so choose. I also have been planning on re-create my OneNote knowledge base into Markdown docs.
