## :octocat: Github Flavored Markdown Template  :page_with_curl:

As each blog post I write is in GitHub-flavored Markdown, I wanted a quicker reference sheet for it, so I created this template [here](https://github.com/XXLMandalorian013/Mark_Down_Templates/blob/main/GitHubMDTemplate/GitHubMDTemplate.md). I pulled most of the syntax from [GitHubâ€™s official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) but with the addition of having the ability to copy and paste the syntax you wish to reference from this template with just one mouse click. I also attempted to structure this template in a way that I believe many individuals would use when beginning to write or format Markdown.

I hope you get some use out of it and it saves you time!
