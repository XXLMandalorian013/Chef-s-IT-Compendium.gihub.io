This is my personal blog, doc host website written in HTML, CSS, and hopefully a little JAVA.

Below is my folder structure

```shell

├   └──styles.css   
├── about.html
├── _tabs
└── index.html
```

To save you time, and also in case you lose some files while copying, we extract those files/configurations of the latest version of the **Chirpy** theme and the [CD][CD] workflow to here, so that you can start writing in minutes.

## Prerequisites

Follow the instructions in the [Jekyll Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to complete the installation of `Ruby`, `RubyGems`, `Jekyll` and `Bundler`.

## Installation

[**Use this template**][use-template] to generate a brand new repository and name it `<GH_USERNAME>.github.io`, where `GH_USERNAME` represents your GitHub username.

Then clone it to your local machine and run:

```
$ bundle
```

## Usage

Please see the [theme's docs](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy#documentation).
